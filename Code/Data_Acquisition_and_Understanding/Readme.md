# This folder hosts code for data acquisition and understanding (exploratory analysis)

#Data prepration
In Jupyter Notebook I have processed multiple .csv files into one big data file. 

#EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
I have draw a pairplot showing correlations between signals (EEG/EKG rigth arm/EKG left arm/GSR).

#To merge data from multiple csv into one csv just change the paths inside Data_exploration.ipynb script.
