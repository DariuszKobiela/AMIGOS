# Contains code for models created to classify data.

# Classical Models

We have made 3 experiments with Decision Trees in python. First with corrupted data, second with the skipped data, and third with random data. The best accuracy was achieved in secong experiment using Bagging and was 27,5%. 

Better accuracy was achieved with Decision Trees in KNIME. The accuracy using Bagging node was 62,5%. 

# Deep Learning Models

In Deep Neural Network model we have achieved accuracy at the average level of 34% basing on deep_learning_data_skipped.csv.
