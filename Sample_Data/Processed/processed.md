I have processed data from multiple data sources into one .csv file. To make calculations easier, medians for every person EKG/EEG/GSR note were calculated. 
For EEG, also mean from medians was taken (multiple medians because of multiple head sensors used in medical examination). 

If the link to the full dataset does not apply, provide some information on how to access the full dataset. 

If the data stays in an Azure file storage, please provide the link to the text file with the information of the file storage that has been checked in to the git repository.
